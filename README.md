# AR-VR Phone

**AR-VR Phone** is an experimental open-source project that transforms your smartphone into a powerful augmented and virtual reality hub. The app will detect and connect to nearby devices automatically, creating a shared digital environment that you can see and interact with in real time.

## 🌍 Vision

Imagine walking into a room and instantly seeing a virtual layer over your surroundings — 3D objects, shared whiteboards, multiplayer games, or even live holograms of people joining remotely. **AR-VR Phone** aims to make that a reality, with just the phone in your pocket.

## ✨ Features (Planned)

- **Automatic Device Discovery** — Find and connect to other AR-VR Phone devices nearby.
- **Shared AR/VR Environment** — Everyone sees the same virtual space in real time.
- **Cross-Platform Support** — Android and iOS compatibility.
- **Low-Latency Communication** — Smooth interactions with WebRTC, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi Direct.
- **Custom Scene Rendering** — Built with ARCore, ARKit, and WebXR.

## 📦 Tech Stack (Proposed)

- **Mobile App:** React Native or Flutter (for cross-platform)  
- **AR Rendering:** ARCore (Android), ARKit (iOS), or WebXR  
- **Networking:** WebRTC, Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi Direct  
- **Backend:** Node.js with WebSocket API (optional for cloud sync)  

## 🚀 Getting Started

> **Note:** This is an early-stage project. The current version may only include basic device discovery and mock AR rendering.
